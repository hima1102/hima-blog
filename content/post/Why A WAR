Title: Why a war?

Blood and gore, 

Eyes encounter Al-naar everywhere. 

On the crooked paths, toddlers astray, 

Searching for family in dismay. 

Woman in labor , hears her newborn cry, 

But the infant hears a BOOM , an explosion.. 

Congrats, the inhumane sly got its seed laid, 

In the heart of a mother and the nation’s future. 

Setting sun jumps into the sea that’s giant, Leaving 

darkness to the warped world. 

Now, Humanity with its blood thirst, 

Drowning itself into the endless ocean of greed . 

Whats a war for? 

For peace ? then why this menace ? 

Bring out dismantled humanity from deep inside 

Before it gets its name encarved in the graveyard.
