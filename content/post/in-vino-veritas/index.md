***<!--StartFragment-->***

***Deep inside the dark woods,*** 

***Feel the eyes of predators,*** 

***Around you, beside you,*** 

***ON you?*** 

***What if its your turn to be prey?*** 

***Left with no words even to pray.*** 

***Soft yet sensible,*** 

***Turned to helpless n incapable.*** 

***Run , run for virtue of being pristine.*** 

***Think for once,*** 

***Place yourself in the goddamn semblance.*** 

***It pushed me into a trance,*** 

***It made me sober ,*** 

***I’m high now , with daze of pestilence.*** 

***In vino veritas non alcoholic*** 

***Dear girls ,*** 

***You’re not in safehands anymore ,*** 

***Raise up, get the spirit of a warrior ,*** 

***Or else..you’ll be given a tag ‘survivor’.***
