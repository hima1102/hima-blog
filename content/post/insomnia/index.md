*<!--StartFragment-->*

*Gazing at the stars ,* 

*I wait for the night to pass* 

*Just as always .* 

*Dim light , snoring dad* 

*And pirouette overhead .* 

*Rolling in the aisles ,* 

*For foolish acts ,* 

*From bygone ages .* 

*Questioning, doubting , reassuring .* 

*All of a sudden ,* 

*Optimism takes a u- turn* 

*Everything changes* 

*Watery eyes turn red* 

*With the rage raising from inside* 

*Thoughts scream* 

*With highest audacity possible* 

*Each scream goes unheard* 

*‘cuz silence has no sound* 

*Squeak…* 

*An unexpected whine falls from nowhere* 

*Frozen muscles shiver with fear ,* 

*Swollen eye lids open ,* 

*Realize there’s darkness nomore ,* 

*Limbs gain courage to stop the thunder.* 

*I wake up .* 

*With weary eyes,* 

*Tired limbs ,* 

*Faked up smile .* 

*One more day to start,* 

*One more scary night,* 

*Euphoria out of sight .*
