*Covered by dust,* 

*I never saw the world crystal clean.* 

*Miracles happen without a hint,* 

*Yes ,oe day I saw her passing by with a kin.* 

*Till then all I knew was,* 

*Brittle cutis earth and dried scorching wind.* 

*With all the might,* 

*I prayed god to give me clear sight.* 

*For once, my wishes reached.* 

*Beloved sky , grey it turned.* 

*Downfall began enrapturing,* 

*Clearing the grime,* 

*Allowing me to HEED.* 

*After a long wait,* 

*I saw her looking at me straight,* 

*From a window , holding hand of her mate.* 

*My heart would’ve stopped ,if it existed.* 

*Hmmm…* 

*After all I am a QUIVERING LEAF* 

*but she'll always be my only Beautiful REEF.*
